            Nishant is a rising senior at Redmond High School in Redmond, WA. He has been playing premier soccer for his whole life,
            and loves the competetive yet fun atmosphere that it brings. As a younger kid, he loved playing sports with older kids and
            still cherishes the memories he had with them. He hopes to bring these memories to as many children as possible!
