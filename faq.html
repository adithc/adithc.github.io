              <p>When selecting a coach, there are a list of a few locations the coach is available to coach at so you can get a gage for whether the coach's location would be feasible for you to go to. Once you book a lesson, you will get the contact
                of the coach so you two can determine a convenient location for both of you.

              <p>All of our coaches are varisty level athletes who have been playing the sport for many years. They were all thoroughly interviewed,
                and then trained to make sure they coach to the standard we expect. In addition to this, a majority of our coaches have coached
                previously either privately or for large companies at summer camps.

              <p>When booking a lesson with a coach, it is reccomended to read the bio of the coach to make sure you guys would be a good fit.
                In addition to this, when booking a lesson with a new coach we reccomend booking a single lesson at first to make sure your child
                and the coach are a good fit, and then based on that you can book a package of 5 or 10 lessons for your child.

            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>To get the best coaching experience possible, it is highly recommended to bring your own equipment such as a ball or a racquet. 
                All of our coaches will come with a ball or a racket based on the sport, but to allow for optimized coaching, bringing your own
                equipment is necessary.
